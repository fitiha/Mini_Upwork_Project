**MANUAL FOR USING THE PLATFORM**

***For Workers***
Use the "Find Work" section if you are a worker
 - Use "Register" to add your profile as a worker
 - Use "Edit Profile" to modify or delete your account profile
 - Use "Exit" to if you finish your task

***For Employers***
Use the "Hire" section if you want peoples to hire
 - Use "Find by ID" to know the details of a worker using his/her ID
 - Use "Find by work type" to get the list of workers sorted by their job type
 - Use "Available Workers List" to find the details of registered available workers
 - Use "List Of Registered Work Types" to find the list of work types our workers got registered for
 - Use "Exit" to if you finish your task

 It's assumed that after an employer gets the right type of worker he/she can contact
 the worker using the provided phone number and other personal informations. However, this will not be the end of this 
 project, we will try to advance the project with some features like:
  - putting  some kind of notification for the employee if he/she got employers attention
  - allowing the employer choose filtering methods for finding employees
  - create a website so that it is accessable over the internet
